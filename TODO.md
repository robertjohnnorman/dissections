# TODO

- Comprehensive test examples for all recursion-schemes.
- Add Recursion Schemes (+ examples) for GADTs, using HFix and HAlgebras.
- Add re-unfolds (e.g. metamorphism)
- Investigate Generalized algebras, and Gather/Scatter.
- Investigate combination algebras (zippa, merga,)
- Investigate 'other' algebras: (synchro, exo, mutu)
- Look into droste's PartialBasis type stuff. Understand and work into this project as needed.
- Ensure it's still easy to declare a dissection type. (Dissect Template?)
- Add 'Show' instance derivation.
- Add Functor -> Generic auto derivation
- Add Recursive Type -> Functor -> Generic auto-derivation
- Review follow-up paper that guarantees convergence (i think?)
- Look into (co/)elgot algebras; and any other missing algebras.
- Look at implementing cursor-like navigation
- Add reconstruction of Huet's zipper by 'plugging' the dissection.
- Add example for 'zygohistomorphic prepromorphism'. Just cause.
- If ready for prime-time, refactor as a droste extension module and propose for inclusion.
